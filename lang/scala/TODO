 - Lots of testing
 - Better record constructors, to validate field types (eg. fixed size or bytes container)
 - equals()
 - hashCode() for unions, mutable fields, composite fields
 - Protocols
 - Builder pattern on Mutable records
 - MutableRecord.put(index, union) is broken
 - Schema reconciliation
