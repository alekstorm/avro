 - Lots of testing
 - Better record constructors, to validate field types (eg. fixed size or bytes container)
 - equals()
 - hashCode() for unions, mutable fields, composite fields
 - Protocols
 - Enum encoding/decoding
 - Compile enums defined in .avsc record files (currently have to define them in a separate .avsc)
 - Builder pattern on Mutable records
 - MutableRecord.put(index, union) is broken
 - Schema reconciliation

 - Avro fields with type NULL should not be reified as Scala fields at all
